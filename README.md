Project: Loans Distributed by the Social Development Bank of Saudi Arabia in 2022

The Social Development Bank is one of the cornerstones of the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
The bank issues interest-free loans for citizens in order to drive development and welfare.
Unlike in other countries, the scope of these loans is broad and largely promotes local values.

Target groups:
* SMEs, employers, freelancers and emerging trades,
* Citizens with limited incomes to overcome financial difficulties,
* MSME sector,
* Supporting important life events such as marriage and family,
* Promoting savings among individuals and institutions.
The Bank has 26 branches in different regions.

The goal of analytics is to assess the distribution of these risk-free loans among the population.
One data entry represents one successful application.
The individual debtors have been anonymized. 
Thus, we do not know whether anyone succeeded in claiming financing multiple times.

The fact analysed is the total sum of a loan.
